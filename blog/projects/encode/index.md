# enCode Code Editor

<!-- <GitHub repo="VaibKS/editor"> -->

This is a simple code editor I made to test my JavaScript skills a few years back.

It works best in Chrome.

## Features

* Syntax Highlighting (supports almost every language)
* Local storage of code in browser
* Downloadable formats: zip & json
* Loadable project from downloaded json file
* Themes (Multiple Dark and Light modes)
* Each file can be individually downloaded
* Fullscreen mode (`Alt+F`)

The code is minified, so don't bother looking into it.
